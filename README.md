## Description

This is an animation that displays two eyes the move along with the curser as the cursor moves across the page.

## How to run

You can fork and clone this repo and add HTML, JS, and CSS files to your system. When you load the HTML file to your browser,
the eyes will follow the cursor across the screen.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements

I'm very pleased with the look and feel of this project. In the future I can maybe add some more animations as well.
